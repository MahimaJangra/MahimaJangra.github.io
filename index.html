                    I contributed extensively to enhancing the frontend of a data visualization platform by implementing interactive UI components using React.js and JavaScript. I integrated the GoJS library to create dynamic, hierarchical diagrams, and developed a multi-tabbed interface to improve user navigation across datasets. Performance optimization was a key focus, where I implemented lazy loading to reduce render times by 30%. I also introduced features like SVG export for visualizations and participated in thorough testing and bug tracking via JIRA. Additionally, I played a vital role in team collaboration through code reviews and knowledge transfer sessions, ensuring code quality and smooth onboarding.

                        Developed a VS Code extension using TypeScript and Eclipse plugin using Java. Designed and implemented a 
                        feature to display the calculated data and results in a custom view window within IDE. 
                        Utilized VS Code's Extension API and Eclipse PDE to integrate and manipulate IDE views, making the results 
                        easily accessible for developers for more insights of project.

                <div class="project-detail">Developed a Python script to automate the process of generating reports in excel sheets. Fetched data from DB 
                    and utilized Pandas and Numpy to manipulate and transform the retrieved data into meaningful insights and 
                    reports. Generated Excel reports using Python libraries such as openpyxl. 
                    Automated the entire process by configuring and scheduling the script to run monthly via Jenkins, ensuring timely 
                    report generation without manual intervention. </div>
